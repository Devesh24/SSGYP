      <h4>Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya : </h4>
      <p>The Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV) scheme was launched by the Government of India in August, 2004 for setting up residential schools at upper primary level for girls belonging predominantly to the SC, ST, OBC and minorities in difficult areas. The scheme was applicable, in Educationally Backward Blocks (EBBs) where the rural female literacy is below the national average (46.13%: Census 2001) and gender gap in literacy is more than the national average (21.59%: Census 2001).
          <span id="dots">....</span>
          <div id="display3" class="display">
            Gender disparities still persist in rural areas and among disadvantaged communities. Hence the enrolment trends show that, there remains a significant gap in the enrolment of girls at the elementary level as compared to boys, especially at the upper primary levels.
The major objective of running a KGBV is to Ensure access and quality education to the girls of disadvantaged groups of society by setting up residential schools at upper primary level. During the meeting, progress of various programme are reviewed, implementation related issues are discussed; experiences and suggestions are shared for facilitating programme implementation in better way. 
Presently 203 KGBVs are functional in the state. Government of India has sanctioned class VI to VIII for these schools where as, State Government upgraded theses schools up to class XII.

    <h4>Scheme for Infrastructure Development in Minority Institutes  : </h4>
    <p>National Policy on Education (NPE) has adopted the concept of a national system of education, implying that all students irrespective of caste, creed, language or sex have access to education of comparable quality. The Policy lays special emphasis on removal of disparities and equalizing educational opportunities by attending to the specific needs of those who have remained educationally backward so far. 2. In pursuance of NPE stipulations, the scheme of Area Intensive Development for ensuring an area intensive approach to education was launched in the IXth Plan. This scheme was merged with Madrasas Modernisation Scheme during the Xth Plan with two components of Modernisation and Infrastructure remaining separate. No financial assistance for infrastructure development was envisaged for Madrasas to whom assistance was restricted to providing honorarium for the teachers teaching modern subjects and assistance under the infrastructure component was provided to Governmental and Non Governmental educational institutions imparting modern education.
