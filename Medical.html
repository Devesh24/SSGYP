        <h4>Aam Aadmi Bima Yojana : </h4>
        <p>This national health insurance scheme was launched in the year 2007 and covers people of age group ranging from 18 to 59 years. It is available for the citizens living in the upcountry or in the backward areas. Under this plan, scholarships are provided to the underprivileged children in rural areas and it also covers the tenants in urban or rural areas. With a premium of Rs. 200 per annum, this scheme protects the health of the head of the family. Upon the natural death of the insured, the family is provided with a sum of Rs. 30,000 for support and for death caused by permanent disability, the family is offered Rs. 75,000.

              The workers in the unorganized sector constitute about 93% of the total work force in the country. The Government has been implementing some social security measures for certain occupational groups but the coverage is miniscule. Majority of the workers are still without any social security coverage. Recognizing the need for providing social security to these workers, the Central Government has introduced a Bill in the Parliament.
              One of the major insecurities for workers in the unorganized sector is the frequent incidences of illness and need for medical care and hospitalization of such workers and their family members. Despite the expansion in the health facilities, illness remains one of the most prevalent causes of human deprivation in India. It has been clearly recognized that health insurance is one way of providing protection to poor households against the risk of health spending leading to poverty. However, most efforts to provide health insurance in the past have faced difficulties in both design and implementation. The poor are unable or unwilling to take up health insurance because of its cost, or lack of perceived benefits. Organizing and administering health insurance, especially in rural areas, is also difficult.
