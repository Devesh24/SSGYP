  <p>This scheme aims to provide protection mechanism to the farmers and cattle rearers against any eventual loss of their animals due to death and to demonstrate the benefit of the insurance of livestock to the people and popularize it with the ultimate goal of attaining qualitative improvement in livestock and their products.
    Livestock Sector is an important sector of national, especially rural economy. The supplemental income derived from rearing of livestock is a great source of support to the farmers facing uncertainties of crop production, apart from providing sustenance to poor and landless farmers.
    For promotion of the livestock sector, it has been felt that along with providing more effective steps for disease control and improvement of genetic quality of animals, a mechanism of assured protection to the farmers and cattle rearers needs to be devised against eventual losses of such animals. In this direction, the Government approved a new centrally sponsored scheme on Livestock Insurance which was implemented on pilot basis during the 10th Plan. From 2008-09 onwards, the scheme is being implemented as a regular scheme in the100 newly selected districts till the end of 11th Five Year Plan i.e. 2011-12.
